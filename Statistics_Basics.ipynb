        " - Qualitative vs. Quantitative Data\n",
        "Qualitative Data is all about descriptions—things you can observe but not measure with numbers. It captures qualities, characteristics, or categories. Think of it as the \"what\" or \"how\" something feels, looks, or behaves. It’s often subjective and collected through methods like interviews, observations, or open-ended surveys.\n",
        "Examples:\n",
        "The smell of rain (fresh, earthy, damp).\n",
        "\n",
        "Colors of cars in a parking lot (red, blue, black).\n",
        "\n",
        "Opinions on a movie (loved it, hated it, thought it was okay).\n",
        "\n",
        "Quantitative Data, on the other hand, deals with numbers—things you can measure or count. It’s objective and answers \"how many,\" \"how much,\" or \"to what extent.\" You’d typically gather this through experiments, surveys with numeric responses, or sensors.\n",
        "\n",
        "Examples:\n",
        "The temperature outside (72°F or 22°C).\n",

        "Time it takes to run a mile (8 minutes).\n",

        "\n",
        "Political affiliation (Democrat, Republican, Independent).\n",
